Notes on rumour annotations
These are some themes that emerged in my reading of the tweets in the annotation exercise.

Cures

Types:

1.	‘They know about the cure but won’t release it’
2.	‘They invented COVID to sell drugs/make money’ 
3.	‘There are cheap and effective cures out there, so no need for the vaccine’ 
4.	‘There are cheap and effective cures out there, but they want to peddle the vaccine’
5.	‘Covid cures other aliments’ e.g. heart disease
6.	‘They had it all planned – even the cure’
Key words:
Gates/ Fauci/ 5G/WHO/Big Pharma = DEPOPULATION

Origins:
 Types:

1.	Created in a lab – usually financed by Gates/ Fauci. “Engineered”. Plandemic (e.g. G/F funded the Wuhan lab to create Covid = depopulation)
2.	Event 201 – big military build up.
3.	Boiweapon – “Lab Terrorism”
4.	Manufactured COVID to ensure everyone had vaccine, so that they could inject microchip
Key issues:
Historical parallels here- Black Death, Spanish Flu, Tuskegee
Depopulation agenda looms large here – as does infertility through vaccine rumours
#Lamestream media

Vaccines:
Types:
1.	Vaccines have toxins with side effects e.g. infertility or include strange ingredients e.g. disinfectant
2.	Microchips/ tracing devices / RFID chip in vaccines
3.	Depopulation again e.g. ‘a man who supports depopulation agenda shouldn’t have anything to do with vaccines’
4.	Vaccines are being tested on others – e.g. in Africa or on children
5.	Control – vaccine as form of control
6.	Historical parallels being invoked again – times when vaccines went wrong
7.	Vaccine is a money making exercise and a monopoly
8.	Fast-tracked vaccine = deadly (now or in time)
9.	Vaccine is deadly (no reason given)
